## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```

Automate tests with guard

```shell
$ bin/spring stop    # Try this if the tests mysteriously start failing.
$ bundle exec guard
```

```
